## How It Works
![Base LLMS](./images/1.%20How%20LLM%20Works.png)
LLMs are trained as supervised Deep Learning algorithms, where current word acts as a true label for all the previous sequence of words. 

## Types of LLMS

2. Types of LLMs
### 1. Base LLMS
- Base LLM finds the next words in the sequence from the knowledge it gained through training.

### 2. Instruction Tuned LLMS
Steps to create a fined tuned LLMs from base LLMs
- Inititially LLMs are trained on large volum of data.
- The first step to tune an LLMs, is to rate the text generated by base LLMs in the context of helpfulness, harmfullness, clarity, correctness etc..
- Now, The objective of instruction tuned LLMs is to generate highly rated output with high probability (with Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)
