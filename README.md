## How It Works
![Base LLMS](./images/1.%20How%20LLM%20Works.png)
LLMs are trained as supervised Deep Learning algorithms, where current word acts as a true label for all the previous sequence of **WORDS**. 

## Types of LLMS
![Base LLMS](./images/2.%20Types%20of%20LLMs.png)
2. Types of LLMs
### 1. Base LLMS
- Base LLM finds the next words in the sequence from the knowledge it gained through training.

### 2. Instruction Tuned LLMS
Steps to create a fined tuned LLMs from base LLMs
- Inititially LLMs are trained on large volum of data.
- The first step to tune an LLMs, is to rate the text generated by base LLMs in the context of helpfulness, harmfullness, clarity, correctness etc..
- Now, The objective of instruction tuned LLMs is to generate highly rated output with high probability (with Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)

#### Note: One thing everyone gets wrong is this Base model conisders previous **TOKENS** to predict next token but not **WORDS**

## Temperature Parameter
Temperature is one of the parameters of OpenAi chat completion client, it takes a value between 0-1 and it is a way to control the type, quality, randomness, creativity of the LLM text generation.

### Low Temperature Value (0.2)
- The LLM generates focused, straight forward, less/no creativity, close to real world responses

### High Temperature Value (0.8)
- The LLM generates highly creative, helucinated, highly random responses


## Input Evaluation: Customer Support Query classification with open ai agent\

- Set the behaviour of assistant as a customer service agent by passing a system message

syestem message
```
system_message = f"""
You will be provided with customer service queries. \
The customer service query will be delimited with \
{delimiter} characters.
Classify each query into a primary category \
and a secondary category. 
Provide your output in json format with the \
keys: primary and secondary.

Primary categories: Billing, Technical Support, \
Account Management, or General Inquiry.

Billing secondary categories:
Unsubscribe or upgrade
Add a payment method
Explanation for charge
Dispute a charge

Technical Support secondary categories:
General troubleshooting
Device compatibility
Software updates

Account Management secondary categories:
Password reset
Update personal information
Close account
Account security

General Inquiry secondary categories:
Product information
Pricing
Feedback
Speak to a human

## OpenAI moderation API

- Identiefies the type of input context, and gives a softmax score for each type. It maily identifies hatred, harmful, violence.
